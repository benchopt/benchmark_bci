# `benchmark_utils` is a module in which you can define code to reuse in
# the benchmark objective, datasets, and solvers. The folder should have the
# name `benchmark_utils`, and code defined inside will be importable using
# the usual import syntax

from benchopt import safe_import_context

# Protect the import with `safe_import_context()`. This allows:
# - skipping import to speed up autocompletion in CLI.
# - getting requirements info when all dependencies are not installed.
with safe_import_context() as import_ctx:
    from .transformation import smooth_timemask, channels_dropout # noqa F401
    from .dataset import windows_data # noqa F401
